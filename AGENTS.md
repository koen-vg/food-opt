# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents contributing to this repository.

## Purpose

Provide clear expectations and a safe, efficient workflow so agents can make small, correct, and reversible changes that fit the project’s conventions.

## Project Overview (brief)

- Global food systems optimization using linear programming.
- Built on PyPSA for modeling and Snakemake for workflow orchestration.
- Configuration-driven; results materialized under `results/{config_name}/`.

## Filesystem Layout

- `config/`: Scenario configuration files and shared YAML fragments; edits here drive what Snakemake targets construct and solve.
- `data/`: Source datasets and mock CSVs used for testing; treat contents as inputs only and keep large/raw data out of Git.
- `docs/`: Sphinx documentation (17 sections covering all model aspects); see `docs/README.md` for build instructions.
- `workflow/`: Snakemake project root with the main `workflow/Snakefile`, modular rules, and workflow scripts under `workflow/scripts/`.
- `tools/`: Utility wrappers (e.g., `tools/smk`) that pin resource limits and interpreter settings for repeatable runs.
- `processing/`: Intermediate datasets that feed the modeled workflow.
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory analyses and sanity-check visualisations.
- `results/`: Auto-generated artifacts organized as `results/{config_name}/`; never hand-edit. Rerun the relevant target instead.
- `vendor/`: A few bundled third-party assets kept in-repo for customised tweaks.

## Core Principles

- Keep code concise: Prefer simple control flow; fail early on invalid external inputs.
- Do your best to avoid over-engineering. If you see possibilities for simplifying, suggest improvements (but let the user approve of such drive-by refactors first).
- Consistent style: Follow existing patterns in nearby files; don’t introduce new paradigms ad hoc.
- Reproducibility: Use the Snakemake targets below to validate changes; don’t hand‑run ad hoc pipelines unless necessary.
- No unused imports: The linter removes them automatically; only add imports when adding code that uses them.
- Do not add `from __future__ import annotations`; type checkers and tooling already expect
  runtime string annotations, so this import is unnecessary and should be avoided.
- Documentation-first interfaces: If you change a script’s inputs/outputs, update inline docstrings and any referenced docs/config keys.
- Mock data: Several CSVs ship with placeholder values to keep the workflow runnable (`README.md` lists them). When touching those files, state clearly that values are mock and confirm with the user before treating them as final data.

## Environment & Tooling

- Dependency manager: `pixi` (see `pixi.toml`).
- Lint/format: `ruff` for Python, `snakefmt` for Snakemake files (auto-enforced via hooks; no manual action usually needed).
- Workflow engine: `snakemake` (run via `tools/smk` wrapper by default).

### Available Environments

- `default`: Base environment with HiGHS solver (open-source)
- `dev`: Development tools (Jupyter, Sphinx, pre-commit, etc.)
- `gurobi`: Includes Gurobi solver (requires license)
- `dev-gurobi`: Development tools + Gurobi solver

Recommended commands (use the memory-capped wrapper):

```bash
# Install and sync dependencies (default environment)
pixi install

# Install with Gurobi solver support
pixi install --environment gurobi

# Install development environment
pixi install --environment dev

# Run the full workflow (data prep → build → solve)
tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/<name>.yaml

# Run with specific environment
pixi run --environment gurobi tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/<name>.yaml

# Build model only
tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/<name>.yaml -- results/{config_name}/build/model.nc

# Solve model only (after build)
tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/<name>.yaml -- results/{config_name}/solved/model.nc

# Build the docs, including figures
tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/doc_figures.yaml -- build_docs

# Test small snippets of code
pixi run python <...>
```

Notes:

- Remember the double dash (--) before any target file, to separate flags from the target file.
- For now, use the config/toy.yaml configuration file.
- Snakemake tracks code changes and will rerun affected rules; manual cleanup of workflow artefacts is unnecessary. You almost never have to use the `--forcerun` argument.
- Prefer small, testable edits and validate by running the narrowest target that exercises your change.
- `tools/smk` runs Snakemake in a systemd cgroup with a hard 10G cap and swap disabled by default; override with `SMK_MEM_MAX=12G tools/smk ...`.
- Retrieval / downloading rules and scripts make network calls; when running such rules you will need to ask for permission to run outside the sandbox in order to get network access.
- Never rerun retrieval rules without explicitly being instructed to do so. This includes implicit calls like an indiscriminate use of the `--forceall` Snakemake argument.

## Repository Conventions

- Scripts used by the workflow live in `workflow/scripts/`.
- Configuration lives under `config/` (e.g., `config.yaml`).
- Input data under `data/`; outputs under `results/` (structured by config name).
- Don’t commit large data or generated results; `.gitignore` and the workflow manage these.
- If you are working on incorporating a new dataset, check that the dataset is listed in data/DATASETS.md.

### Git guidelines

- AI Agents (Claude, Codex, etc) should not add themselves as co-authors to commits unless explicitly asked for.

## PyPSA Modeling Notes

- Use standard PyPSA components: carriers, buses, stores, links, etc.
- For multi-bus links:
  - `bus0` is the (first) input bus.
  - `bus1` is the (first) output bus; `efficiency` governs bus0→bus1.
  - `bus2`, `bus3`, … are additional legs with `efficiency2`, `efficiency3`, …
    - Positive efficiency ⇒ output; negative ⇒ input (relative to `bus0`).

## When Implementing Changes

- Keep function/module scope tight; avoid broad rewrites.
- Mirror existing error handling: validate external data; trust internal invariants.
- Add or adjust docstrings where behavior or parameters change.
- If you add a new rule or script, integrate it into the `workflow/Snakefile` and ensure targets are reproducible.
- Don’t introduce network calls or external services in core code unless explicitly required by the task.

## Documentation

- Comprehensive Sphinx documentation lives in `docs/` with 17 major sections covering:
  - Model framework, components, and mathematical formulation
  - Data sources, workflow execution, and configuration
  - All model aspects: land use, crops, livestock, nutrition, health, environment
  - Contributing guidelines, API reference
- When adding features or changing behavior, update relevant documentation sections in `docs/*.rst`.
- Build docs locally: `cd docs && make html` (requires `pixi install --environment dev`).
- Documentation is version-controlled and builds automatically on ReadTheDocs.

### Documentation Figures

**Important**: Documentation figures are **NOT tracked in git**. They are:
- Generated locally via Snakemake using the lightweight `config/doc_figures.yaml` configuration
- Uploaded to a GitHub Release (tag: `doc-figures`)
- Referenced in `.rst` files via GitHub release URLs
- Located in `docs/_static/figures/*` (ignored by `.gitignore`)

When updating documentation figures:

```bash
# 1. Generate figures
tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/doc_figures.yaml -- build_docs

# 2. Upload to GitHub release (requires gh CLI authentication)
tools/upload-doc-figures

# 3. Update .rst references to use remote URLs
tools/update-figure-refs --to-remote

# 4. Commit only the .rst changes (not the figures)
git add docs/*.rst
git commit -m "Update documentation figures"
```

For local testing, you can use local figure paths:
```bash
tools/update-figure-refs --to-local
make html  # Build docs with local figures
tools/update-figure-refs --to-remote  # Switch back before committing
```

**Never** commit figure files (`*.png`, `*.svg`) to git - they are hosted externally to keep the repository lean.

## Validation Checklist

- Narrow target runs clean via Snakemake for at least one `config_name`.
- No new linter errors; no unused imports.
- Results land under the expected `results/{config_name}/...` path(s).
- Documentation updated when changing user-visible behavior (check `docs/*.rst` for relevant sections).

## Safety & Licensing

- Respect SPDX headers; keep or add them to new files following repository practice.
- Do not introduce secrets, credentials, or hard-coded local paths.
- Use only licensed datasets and dependencies already declared in `pixi.toml` unless explicitly instructed to add new ones.
