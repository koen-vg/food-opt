# Configuration for generating documentation figures
# This inherits from default.yaml but uses coarser resolution for faster execution
# and to showcase global coverage without excessive computational cost

name: "doc_figures"

# Use coarser spatial aggregation for faster processing
aggregation:
  regions:
    target_count: 250  # Reduced from 400 for faster processing
  resource_class_quantiles: [0.33, 0.67]  # Just 3 classes instead of 4
  land_limit_dataset: "irrigated"

# Fewer trade hubs for simpler network visualization
trade:
  crop_hubs: 10  # Reduced from 20

# Fewer health clusters

# Override the full crop list with a limited subset for fast execution
# This replaces the default crops list entirely
crops:
  - wheat          # Major cereal
  - wetland-rice   # Major cereal (Asia)
  - maize          # Major cereal (Americas/Africa)
  - soybean        # Major legume/oil crop
  - white-potato   # Major tuber
  - cassava        # Major tropical staple
  - tomato         # Vegetable
  - banana         # Fruit

# Add minimum consumption constraints to showcase animal products in figures
# Values in g/person/day (modest minima to ensure some production)
