# Mapping from model foods to FAOSTAT Food Balance Sheet (FBS) item codes.
# Used for calculating within-group food consumption ratios from FBS supply data.
#
# When multiple model foods map to the same FBS item, their supply is split
# equally among them during ratio calculation.
#
# Byproducts (wheat-bran, rice-bran, etc.) are excluded from ratio calculation
# but included here for completeness.
