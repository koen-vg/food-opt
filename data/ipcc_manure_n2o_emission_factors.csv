# Sources:
# - Storage EFs: IPCC 2019 Refinement, Vol 4, Chapter 10, Table 10.21
# - Pasture deposition EFs: IPCC 2019 Refinement, Vol 4, Chapter 11, Table 11.1 (EF3PRP)
# - Application EF (EF1): IPCC 2019 Refinement, Vol 4, Chapter 11, Table 11.1
#
# Notes:
# - storage_ef: kg N2O-N per kg N in MMS (direct emissions during storage)
# - is_pasture: if true, uses EF3PRP instead of storage+application pathway
# - ef3prp_cattle: EF for cattle/buffalo pasture deposition (0.02)
# - ef3prp_other: EF for sheep/goats/pigs/poultry pasture deposition (0.01)
# - For non-pasture systems, application emissions (EF1=0.006) are added separately
