# Manually Downloaded Data

This directory contains datasets that must be manually downloaded because they:
- Require interactive query interfaces (e.g., IHME GBD Results Tool)
- Have terms-of-service that preclude automated bulk downloads
- Require authentication or registration

## Current Files

### IHME-GBD_2023-dealth-rates.csv

**Source:** IHME Global Burden of Disease Study 2023

Viewing and downloading these results requires a user account on the healthdata.org website.

**Query parameters:**
- **GBD Estimate:** Cause of death or injury
- **Measure:** Deaths (Rate per 100,000)
- **Metric:** Rate
- **Causes:**
  - All causes
  - Ischemic heart disease
  - Stroke
  - Diabetes mellitus
  - Colon and rectum cancer
  - Chronic respiratory diseases
- **Location:** Choose option to "Select all countries and territories"
- **Age groups:** <1 year, 12-23 months, 2-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years, 15-19 years, ..., 95+ years
- **Sex:** Both
- **Year:** 2023 (or latest available)

This specific query can also be found at the following URL: https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results?params=gbd-api-2023-permalink/05de3cfb56eafc99f2cc8e135644b81f

**Processing:** The Snakemake workflow automatically processes this file via `workflow/scripts/prepare_gbd_mortality.py` to:
1. Map country names to ISO3 codes
2. Map IHME causes to model cause codes
3. Aggregate sub-buckets (12-23 months + 2-4 years → 1-4)
4. Convert rates from per 100k to per 1k
5. Output to `processing/{name}/gbd_mortality_rates.csv`

### GDD-dietary-intake (directory)

**Source:** Global Dietary Database (Tufts University)
**Download:** https://globaldietarydatabase.org/data-download

Downloading requires free user registration and acceptance of terms of use.

**Dataset details:**
- **Content:** Country-level mean daily dietary intake (g/day per capita) for major food groups and dietary risk factors
- **Food groups:** Vegetables, fruits (temperate/tropical/starchy), whole grains, legumes, nuts & seeds, red meat (beef/lamb/pork), processed meat, seafood (fish types + shellfish), grains, dairy, eggs, oils, and others
- **Coverage:** 185+ countries with data circa 2015-2020
- **Format:** CSV (~1.6 GB) with columns for country, food item, mean intake, standard error, and uncertainty bounds
- **Use case:** Baseline dietary patterns for health risk assessment

**Processing:** The Snakemake workflow processes this file via `workflow/scripts/prepare_gdd_dietary_intake.py` to:
1. Filter to baseline (BMK) scenario equivalent
2. Map country names to ISO3 codes
3. Map GDD food items to model dietary risk factors
4. Aggregate multiple food items to risk factor categories
5. Output to `processing/{name}/dietary_intake_baseline.csv`

### IHME_GBD_2019_RELATIVE_RISKS_Y2020M10D15.XLSX

**Source:** IHME Global Burden of Disease Study 2019
**Download:** https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/gbd-2019-relative-risks

Direct file link: https://ghdx.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/record-attached-files/IHME_GBD_2019_RELATIVE_RISKS_Y2020M10D15.XLSX

**Query parameters:**
- **Measure:** Relative Risk
- **Risk factors:** Diet-related risks (high red meat, low vegetables, low fruits, etc.)
- **Causes:** Ischemic heart disease, Stroke, Diabetes, Colon and rectum cancer, Chronic respiratory diseases
- **Age groups:** All age groups
- **Sex:** Both
- **Year:** 2019

**Processing:** The Snakemake workflow processes this file via `workflow/scripts/prepare_relative_risks.py` to:
1. Extract relative risk values for dietary risk factors
2. Map age groups to model age buckets
3. Map causes to model cause codes
4. Output to `processing/{name}/relative_risks.csv`
