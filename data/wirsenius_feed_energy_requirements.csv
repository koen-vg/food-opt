# Description:
# Estimated feed energy requirements to produce one unit of animal product output.
# Values calculated from productivity estimates in Wirsenius (2000) Table 3.8.
# Regional variation reflects differences in production systems, breed genetics,
# climate, and management practices.
#
# Energy units:
# - NE_l: Net energy for lactation (MJ per kg product) - dairy production
# - NE_m: Net energy for maintenance (MJ per kg product) - basic metabolism
# - NE_g: Net energy for growth (MJ per kg product) - body mass gain
# - ME: Metabolizable energy (MJ per kg product) - for monogastrics
#
# Animal products mapped to model categories:
# - "dairy" includes cattle milk production (with carcass as byproduct)
# - "cattle meat" includes dedicated beef production from beef breeds
# - "pig meat" is pig carcass (carcass-side as-is)
# - "eggs" includes egg production (with hen carcass as byproduct)
# - "chicken meat" is meat-type chicken (eviscerated carcass as-is)
#
# Note: The original table included "Dairy bulls & heifers carcass" which is
# excluded here as it represents a byproduct flow already captured in dairy systems.
