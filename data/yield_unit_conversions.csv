# Per-crop yield unit conversions for GAEZ potential yields.
#
# Default conversion assumes rasters report kg dry matter per hectare
# (factor 0.001 to obtain t DM/ha). Only crops listed below deviate from
# that convention.
#
# Column definitions:
# - code: crop identifier used in this repository
# - factor_to_t_per_ha: multiply the raw raster value by this factor to
#   obtain tonnes of dry matter per hectare
# - note: optional human-readable note

oil-palm,0.001666667,Convert kg oil/ha to t DM fruit/ha (24% oil; assumes 60% moisture)
sugarbeet,0.0024,Convert kg sugar/ha to t DM beet/ha (10% sugar extraction; assumes 76% moisture)
sugarcane,0.001928571,Convert kg sugar/ha to t DM cane/ha (14% sugar extraction; assumes 73% moisture)
