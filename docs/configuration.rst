Configuration
=============

Overview
--------

The food-opt model is configuration-driven: all scenario parameters, crop selections, constraints, and solver options are defined in YAML configuration files under ``config/``. This allows exploring different scenarios without modifying code.

The default configuration is ``config/default.yaml``, structured into thematic sections.

Custom configuration files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of modifying the default configuration file, it is recommended to explore individual scenarios by creating named configuration files, overriding specific parts of the default configuration. Such a named configuration file must contain at the minimum a ``name``. An example could be something like the following: 

.. code-block:: yaml

   # config/my_scenario.yaml
   name: "my_scenario"           # Scenario name → results/my_scenario/
   planning_horizon: 2040        # Override the default 2030 horizon
   land:
     regional_limit: 0.6         # Tighten land availability
     slack_marginal_cost: 1e10   # Optional: raise slack penalty during validation
   emissions:
     ghg_price: 250              # Raise the carbon price above the default

Any keys omitted in your custom file fall back to the defaults shown in the sections below, so you can keep overrides concise.

Results are saved under ``results/{name}/``, allowing multiple scenarios coming from different configuration files to coexist.

To build and solve the model based on the above example configuration, you would run the following::

  tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/my_scenario.yaml

Scenario Presets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The workflow supports scenario presets defined in ``config/scenarios.yaml`` that apply configuration overrides via a ``{scenario}`` wildcard. This allows exploring variations (e.g., with/without health constraints or GHG pricing) within a single configuration without duplicating config files.

Each scenario preset in ``scenarios.yaml`` contains a set of configuration overrides that are applied recursively on top of the base configuration. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # config/scenarios.yaml
   default:
     health:
       enabled: false
     emissions:
       ghg_pricing_enabled: false

   HG:
     health:
       enabled: true
     emissions:
       ghg_pricing_enabled: true

The scenario name becomes part of all output paths:

- Built models: ``results/{name}/build/model_scen-{scenario}.nc``
- Solved models: ``results/{name}/solved/model_scen-{scenario}.nc``
- Plots: ``results/{name}/plots/scen-{scenario}/``

To build a specific scenario::

  tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/my_scenario.yaml -- results/my_scenario/build/model_scen-HG.nc

This feature enables systematic sensitivity analysis and comparison across policy scenarios using a single configuration file.

Validation Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: validation ---
   :end-before: # --- section: land ---

* ``validation.harvest_area_source`` chooses the dataset for harvested area in validation runs: ``gaez`` (default, RES06-HAR) or ``cropgrids`` (CROPGRIDS v1.08). The workflow switches aggregation scripts accordingly.

Set ``validation.enforce_gdd_baseline`` to ``true`` to force the optimizer to match
baseline consumption derived from the processed GDD file. When this flag is active,
the ``diet.baseline_age`` and ``diet.baseline_reference_year`` settings determine which
cohort/year is enforced. Use ``validation.food_group_slack_marginal_cost`` to set the
penalty (USD\ :sub:`2024` per Mt) for the slack generators that backstop those fixed
food-group loads. Keep the value high so slack only activates when recorded production
cannot meet the enforced demand targets.

Production Stability Bounds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``validation.production_stability`` section allows constraining how much crop and
animal product production can deviate from current (baseline) levels. This is useful for
investigating what positive changes (e.g., improved health outcomes, reduced emissions)
can be achieved with limited disruption to existing production patterns.

When enabled, the solver applies per-(product, country) bounds of the form:

.. math::

   (1 - \delta) \times \text{baseline} \le \text{production} \le (1 + \delta) \times \text{baseline}

where :math:`\delta` is the ``max_relative_deviation`` parameter (e.g., 0.2 for ±20%).

**Configuration options**:

* ``production_stability.enabled``: Master switch for the feature (default: ``false``)
* ``production_stability.crops.enabled``: Apply bounds to crop production
* ``production_stability.crops.max_relative_deviation``: Maximum relative deviation for crops (0-1)
* ``production_stability.animals.enabled``: Apply bounds to animal product production
* ``production_stability.animals.max_relative_deviation``: Maximum relative deviation for animal products (0-1)

**Behavior notes**:

* Products with zero baseline production are constrained to zero (no new products introduced)
* Products missing baseline data are skipped with a warning
* Multi-cropping is automatically disabled when production stability is enabled

Configuration sections
----------------------

Scenario Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: scenario_metadata ---
   :end-before: # --- section: downloads ---

* **planning_horizon**: Target year for optimization (default: 2030). Currently determined only which (projected) population levels to use.
* **currency_base_year**: Base year for inflation-adjusted USD values (default: 2024). All cost data is automatically converted to real USD in this base year using CPI adjustments. See :doc:`crop_production` (Production Costs section) for details on cost modeling.

Download Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: downloads ---
   :end-before: # --- section: validation ---

Crop Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: crops ---
   :end-before: # --- section: multiple_cropping ---

See :doc:`crop_production` for full list. Add/remove crops to explore specialized vs. diversified production systems.

Multiple Cropping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: multiple_cropping ---
   :end-before: # --- section: macronutrients ---

Define sequential cropping systems as ordered lists of crops. Entries may
repeat a crop (double rice) or mix cereals and legumes (rice→wheat, maize→soybean) and
list multiple ``water_supplies`` (``r`` for rainfed, ``i`` for irrigated) to build both
variants. The ``build_multi_cropping`` rule checks growing-season compatibility,
aggregates eligible area/yields, and sums irrigated water demand; ``build_model`` turns
each combination into a multi-output land link. Leave the section empty to disable the
feature. Multiple cropping zones that imply relay cropping (GAEZ classes "limited double" or
"double rice … limited triple") are still accepted here but are interpreted as sequential crop
chains; relay-specific dynamics are not yet modelled.

Country Coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: countries ---
   :end-before: # --- section: data ---

Include countries/territories to model; exclude to reduce problem size. Microstate and countries missing essential data are commented out.

Spatial Aggregation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Controls regional resolution and land classification.

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: aggregation ---
   :end-before: # --- section: countries ---

**Trade-offs**:
  * More regions → higher spatial resolution, longer solve time
  * Fewer resource classes → faster solving, less yield heterogeneity

Land, Fertilizer, and Residues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Limits on land, fertilizer availability, and residue management.

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: land ---
   :end-before: # --- section: fertilizer ---

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: fertilizer ---
   :end-before: # --- section: residues ---

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: residues ---
   :end-before: # --- section: emissions ---

GAEZ Data Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configures which GAEZ v5 climate scenario and input level to use.

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: data ---
   :end-before: # --- section: irrigation ---

**Scenarios**:
  * SSP126: Strong mitigation (1.5-2°C warming)
  * SSP370: Moderate emissions (~3°C)
  * SSP585: High emissions (~4-5°C)

**Input Levels**:
  * H: Modern agriculture (fertilizer, irrigation, pest control)
  * L: Subsistence farming (minimal external inputs)

Irrigation
~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: irrigation ---
   :end-before: # --- section: solving ---

Restrict irrigation to water-scarce scenarios or explore rainfed-only production.

Macronutrients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: macronutrients ---
   :end-before: # --- section: animal_products ---

Use ``min``, ``max``, or ``equal`` constraints.

Food Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: food_groups ---
   :end-before: # --- section: diet ---

``included`` lists the food groups tracked by the model. ``constraints`` is an
optional mapping where any included group may define ``min``, ``max``, or
``equal`` targets in g/person/day. Leaving ``constraints`` empty disables all
food group limits; add entries only for the groups you want to control.

Diet Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: diet ---
   :end-before: # --- section: biomass ---

Customize ``baseline_age`` or ``baseline_reference_year`` if you pre-process alternative
cohorts or years for the baseline diet. These values are used whenever
``validation.enforce_gdd_baseline`` is set to ``true``.

Biomass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: biomass ---
   :end-before: # --- section: trade ---

Set ``enabled: true`` to create a per-country ``biomass`` bus that tracks dry-matter
exports to the energy sector. All foods listed under ``byproducts`` gain optional links
to this bus, and any crops listed in ``biomass.crops`` can be diverted directly as
feedstocks. The ``marginal_cost`` parameter (USD\ :sub:`2024` per tonne dry matter) sets
the price received when biomass leaves the food system.

Animal Products
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: animal_products ---
   :end-before: # --- section: food_groups ---

Disable grazing to force intensive feed-based systems.

Trade Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: trade ---
   :end-before: # --- section: health ---

Increase trade costs to explore localized food systems; decrease for globalized trade.

All trade costs are expressed in USD_2024 per tonne per kilometer.

Emissions Pricing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: emissions ---
   :end-before: # --- section: land use change ---

Land Use Change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: land use change ---
   :end-before: # --- section: crops ---

Controls how land use change emissions and carbon sequestration are modeled over the planning horizon.

**Parameters**:
  * ``horizon_years``: Time horizon (years) for amortizing land use change emissions
  * ``managed_flux_mode``: How to treat emissions from existing managed land (``"zero"`` assumes no net flux from current agricultural land)
  * ``forest_fraction_threshold``: Minimum forest cover fraction (0-1) required for a grid cell to be eligible for regrowth sequestration when land is spared
  * ``spared_land_agb_threshold_tc_per_ha``: Maximum above-ground biomass (tonnes C per hectare) for spared land to be eligible for regrowth sequestration

Health Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: health ---
   :end-before: # --- section: aggregation ---

Reduce ``region_clusters`` or ``log_rr_points`` to speed up solving.

The ``value_per_yll`` parameter monetizes health impacts in USD_2024 per year of life lost (YLL).

Solver Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: solving ---
   :end-before: # --- section: plotting ---

**Solver choice**:
  * **HiGHS**: Open-source, fast, good for most problems
  * **Gurobi**: Commercial, often faster for very large problems, requires license (free for academic users)

Plotting Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: plotting ---

Customize visualization colors for publication-quality plots. The
``colors.food_groups`` palette is applied consistently across all food-group
charts and maps; extend it if you add new groups to ``data/food_groups.csv``.
