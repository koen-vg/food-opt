Crop Production
===============

Overview
--------

The crop production module translates GAEZ yield potentials and land availability into production constraints for the optimization model. Each crop can be grown in multiple regions, on different resource classes, and potentially with either rainfed or irrigated water supply.

Crop Coverage
-------------

The default configuration includes over 60 crops spanning major food categories:

**Cereals**
  * Wheat, dryland rice, wetland rice, maize
  * Barley, oat, rye, sorghum
  * Buckwheat, foxtail millet, pearl millet

**Legumes and Pulses**
  * Soybean, dry pea, chickpea
  * Cowpea, gram, phaseolus bean, pigeonpea

**Roots and Tubers**
  * White potato, sweet potato, cassava, yam

**Vegetables**
  * Tomato, carrot, onion, cabbage

**Fruits**
  * Banana, citrus, coconut

**Oil Crops**
  * Sunflower, rapeseed, groundnut
  * Sesame, oil palm, olive

**Sugar Crops**
  * Sugarcane, sugarbeet

**Fodder Crops**
  * Alfalfa, biomass sorghum

The complete crop list is configured in ``config/default.yaml`` under the ``crops`` key.

.. Note:: Managed grassland is also modelled, but yields derived from the LPJmL mode; see :ref:`grassland-yields`

GAEZ Yield Data
---------------

Yield potentials come from the FAO/IIASA Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) v5 dataset, which provides spatially-explicit crop suitability and attainable yields under various scenarios. The GAEZ documentation can be found `here <https://github.com/un-fao/gaezv5/wiki>`_. `Module II <https://github.com/un-fao/gaezv5/wiki/04.-Module-II-(Biomass-and-yield-calculation)#biomass-and-yield-calculation>`_ gives more details on biomass and yield calculations (including links to appendices with detailed calculations and parameter choices); subsequent modules apply climatic and technical constraints to arrive at potential yields in `Module V <https://github.com/un-fao/gaezv5/wiki/07.-Module-V-(Integration-of-climatic-and-edaphic-evaluation)>`_.

All RES05 yield rasters used here are provided on a 0.083333° (~5 arc-minute, ≈9 km at the equator) latitude–longitude grid, which sets the native spatial resolution before aggregation to optimization regions.

GAEZ Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key GAEZ parameters in ``config/default.yaml``:

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: data ---
   :end-before: # --- section: irrigation ---

**Climate Models**: Individual global circulation models (GCMs): GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MRI-ESM2-0, UKESM1-0-LL; or multi-model ENSEMBLE

**Periods**:
  * Historical: HP8100 (1981-2000), HP0120 (2001-2020)
  * Future: FP2140 (2021-2040), FP4160 (2041-2060), FP6180 (2061-2080), FP8100 (2081-2100)

**Scenarios**: SSP126 (low emissions), SSP370 (medium), SSP585 (high), HIST (historical)

**Input Levels**:
  * "H" (high): Modern agricultural inputs (fertilizer, irrigation, pest management)
  * "L" (low): Subsistence farming practices

GAEZ Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The model uses several GAEZ raster products for each crop:

* **YCX** (RES05): Attainable yield on current cropland (kg/ha or other units)
* **SX1** (RES05): Suitability index (fraction of gridcell suitable for cultivation)
* **WDC** (RES05): Net irrigation water requirement during crop cycle (mm)
* **Growing season start** (RES02): Julian day when growing season begins
* **Growing season length** (RES02): Number of days in growing cycle

.. Note:: RES05 (yields/suitability) supports ENSEMBLE, but RES02 (growing season) only has individual GCM outputs.

The following figures show yield potential maps for three major crops, illustrating the spatial variation in productivity that drives the optimization:

   :alt: Maize yield potential map

   Maize rainfed yield potential (tonnes/hectare) from GAEZ v5. Maize is adaptable across diverse climates, with strong yields in the Americas, parts of Africa, and temperate zones.

Yield Aggregation
-----------------

Yields are aggregated from the input resolution gridcells to (region, resource_class, water_supply) combinations by ``workflow/scripts/build_crop_yields.py``.

Aggregation Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Load resource classes**: Read the class assignment raster (see :doc:`land_use`)

2. **Load crop-specific rasters**:

   * Yield potential (kg/ha, converted to t/ha)
   * Suitability fraction (0-1)
   * Water requirement (mm, converted to m³/ha)
   * Growing season timing (start day, length)

3. **Unit conversions**: Apply crop-specific conversion factors

   * Default: 0.001 (kg/ha → t/ha)
   * Custom factors in ``data/yield_unit_conversions.csv`` (convert sugar and oil outputs back to dry-matter crop yields)

4. **Mask by suitability**: Only aggregate over suitable land (SX1 > 0)

5. **Compute class averages**: Within each (region, resource_class) combination:

   * Mean yield (t/ha) weighted by suitable area
   * Mean water requirement (m³/ha)
   * Modal growing season start and length

6. **Output**: CSV file (``processing/{name}/crop_yields/{crop}_{water_supply}.csv``) with tidy columns:

   * ``region`` – Optimization region ID
   * ``resource_class`` – Class number
   * ``variable`` – One of ``yield``, ``suitable_area``, ``water_requirement_m3_per_ha``, ``growing_season_start_day``, ``growing_season_length_days``
   * ``unit`` – Physical unit for the variable (``t/ha``, ``ha``, ``m³/ha``, ``day-of-year``, ``days``)
   * ``value`` – Numeric value for the (region, class, variable) triplet

Resource Class Yields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because resource classes are defined by yield quantiles (see :doc:`land_use`), yields generally increase with class number. For example, in a particular region with quantiles [0.25, 0.5, 0.75], we might see the following average yields by resource class:

* Class 0: 1.5 t/ha (bottom quartile land)
* Class 1: 2.8 t/ha (second quartile)
* Class 2: 4.2 t/ha (third quartile)
* Class 3: 6.5 t/ha (top quartile)

This allows the optimizer to preferentially allocate crops to high-quality land or expand onto marginal land as needed.

The following figure illustrates this variation, comparing rainfed wheat yields between resource classes 1 and 2 across all regions:

.. figure:: https://github.com/Sustainable-Solutions-Lab/food-opt/releases/download/doc-figures/crop_yield_resource_class_wheat.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Wheat yields by resource class

   Comparison of wheat rainfed yields (tonnes/hectare) between resource class 1 (left) and resource class 2 (right). Resource class 2 represents higher-quality land and generally shows higher yields across most regions, demonstrating how the resource class stratification captures land quality variation.

.. Note:: Yields for individual crops need not always be better in a high resource class. This is because resource classes are determined "globally" for all crops at once, so that each grid cell is assigned a resource class independent of any crop. So while resource class 2 has better *average* yields than resource class 1 in every region, that might not be true for some individual crops (e.g. rainfed wheat in the Western USA region in the above example.)

Production Constraints
----------------------

In the PyPSA model (``workflow/scripts/build_model.py``), crop production is represented as multi-bus links:

**Inputs**:
  * Land (from land bus for the region/class/water combination)
  * Water (for irrigated crops only)
  * Fertilizer (for all crops, with configurable N-P-K requirements)

**Outputs**:
  * Crop product (to crop bus)
  * Emissions (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O)

**Efficiency Parameters**:
  * ``efficiency`` (bus0→bus1): Yield in t/ha
  * ``efficiency2`` (bus2, negative): Water requirement in m³/t
  * ``efficiency3`` (bus3, negative): Fertilizer requirement in kg/t
  * ``efficiency4`` (bus4, positive): Emissions in tCO₂-eq/t

When crops are converted into foods, the model first rescales the dry-matter crop bus to fresh edible mass using FAO edible portion coefficients and moisture shares drawn from ``data/crop_moisture_content.csv``. The scaling factor ``edible_portion_coefficient / (1 - moisture_fraction)`` is applied before product-specific extraction factors in ``data/foods.csv``. Crops listed in ``data/yield_unit_conversions.csv`` are the cases where GAEZ reports processed outputs (sugar or oil); the table converts those back to dry matter so that subsequent processing logic is uniform.

**Crop-specific exceptions**: For certain crops, FAO's edible portion coefficients do not match the model's yield units, requiring special handling in ``workflow/scripts/prepare_fao_edible_portion.py``:

* **Grains** (rice, barley, oat, buckwheat): FAO coefficients reflect milled/hulled conversion, but we track whole grain. Coefficient forced to 1.0; milling handled separately.
* **Sugar crops** (sugarcane, sugarbeet) and **oil-palm**: GAEZ reports processed outputs (sugar or palm oil). Yields are converted back to whole-crop dry matter via ``data/yield_unit_conversions.csv``, and edible portion coefficients are forced to 1.0 so that extraction losses are handled in ``data/foods.csv``.

The model constrains:

* Total land used per (region, class, water) ≤ available land
* Total water used per region ≤ blue water availability (see water constraints)
* Total fertilizer used globally ≤ global fertilizer limit

Production Costs
----------------

Crop production incurs economic costs that are included in the optimization objective. The model uses bottom-up mechanistic cost estimates from USDA Economic Research Service data, providing detailed production cost breakdowns per hectare of planted area.

Data Source
~~~~~~~~~~~

Cost data comes from the USDA ERS Cost and Returns database, which tracks detailed production costs for major U.S. field crops from 1996-2024. The data is retrieved automatically via ``workflow/scripts/retrieve_usda_costs.py``. The USDA has production cost data on only a subset of crops included in this model:

* **Direct data**: 9 crops with USDA coverage (wheat, maize, rice, barley, oats, sorghum, soybeans, groundnuts, cotton)
* **Fallback mappings**: Other crops use costs from similar crops via ``data/crop_cost_fallbacks.yaml``

  * Other cereals → wheat or maize
  * Other legumes → soybean
  * Vegetables, roots, fruits → wheat (as general row crop proxy)
  * Oil crops → soybean or groundnut

All costs are inflation-adjusted* to a common base year (configurable via ``currency_base_year`` in ``config/default.yaml``, default: 2024) using CPI-U data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Cost Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Production costs are split into two categories to accurately model economies of scale in multiple cropping systems:

**Per-year costs** (annual fixed costs):

* Capital recovery of machinery and equipment (depreciation)
* General farm overhead
* Taxes and insurance

These costs are incurred once per year regardless of how many crops are planted.

**Per-planting costs** (variable costs per crop):

* Seed
* Chemicals (pesticides, herbicides)
* Labor (hired and opportunity cost of unpaid labor)
* Fuel, lubrication, and electricity
* Repairs and maintenance
* Custom services (hired machinery)
* Interest on operating capital

These costs are incurred for each crop planting operation.

**Example breakdown** (wheat, USD_2024/ha):

* Per-year costs: $354.88/ha
* Per-planting costs: $306.76/ha
* **Total single crop**: $661.64/ha

Costs Explicitly Excluded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To avoid double-counting with endogenously-modeled constraints, the following USDA cost categories are excluded:

* **Fertilizer**: Modeled separately with quantity constraints and emissions
* **Land opportunity costs**: Land allocation is optimized, not a fixed cost
* **Irrigation water**: Water is a separate resource constraint with availability limits

Single Crop Production
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For standard single-crop production, the total cost is simply:

.. math::

   \text{Cost}_{\text{single}} = \text{Cost}_{\text{per-year}} + \text{Cost}_{\text{per-planting}}

This cost is applied per hectare of land used (converted to USD/Mha internally for numerical stability):

.. code-block:: python

   # Single crop marginal cost (USD/Mha)
   marginal_cost = (cost_per_year + cost_per_planting) × 1e6

Multiple Cropping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For multiple cropping sequences (e.g., wheat followed by rice on the same land), costs are allocated more carefully:

* **Per-year costs are averaged** across crops (machinery, overhead are shared)
* **Per-planting costs are summed** (each crop requires its own operations)

.. math::

   \text{Cost}_{\text{multi}} = \frac{\sum_i \text{Cost}_{\text{per-year},i}}{n} + \sum_i \text{Cost}_{\text{per-planting},i}

where :math:`n` is the number of crops in the sequence.

**Example: Wheat + Rice** (USD_2024/ha):

* Wheat per-year: $354.88/ha
* Rice per-year: $604.66/ha
* Wheat per-planting: $306.76/ha
* Rice per-planting: $1,541.76/ha

If planted separately:

* Wheat: $661.64/ha
* Rice: $2,146.42/ha
* **Total: $2,808.06 on 2 hectares**

If planted sequentially on same hectare:

* Per-year (averaged): ($354.88 + $604.66) / 2 = $479.77/ha
* Per-planting (summed): $306.76 + $1,541.76 = $1,848.52/ha
* **Total: $2,328.29 on 1 hectare**
* **Savings: $479.77 (17.1%)** from shared machinery and overhead

Workflow Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cost data is processed through several steps:

1. **CPI retrieval** (``retrieve_cpi_data`` rule):

   * Fetches annual CPI-U averages from BLS API
   * Stores in ``processing/shared/cpi_annual.csv``
   * Reusable across workflow for any inflation adjustment

2. **Cost retrieval** (``retrieve_usda_costs`` rule):

   * Downloads USDA crop cost CSVs
   * Filters to relevant cost categories (per-year vs. per-planting)
   * Inflates to base year using CPI data
   * Averages over 2015-2024
   * Converts from $/acre to $/ha (factor: 2.47105)
   * Maps crops via ``data/crop_cost_fallbacks.yaml``
   * Outputs: ``processing/{name}/usda_costs.csv``

3. **Model integration** (``build_model.py``):

   * Reads split costs (per-year and per-planting)
   * Applies simple sum for single crops
   * Applies averaged per-year + summed per-planting for multiple cropping

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The base year for all currency values is configured in ``config/default.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   currency_base_year: 2024  # Base year for inflation-adjusted USD values

Changing this value will automatically:

* Adjust CPI retrieval range
* Inflate all cost data to the new base year
* Update column names in output files (e.g., ``cost_usd_2025_per_ha``)

Water Constraints
-----------------

For irrigated crops, water availability is a key constraint. The model tracks blue water availability by basin and growing season.

Basin-Level Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The model uses the Water Footprint Network's monthly blue water availability dataset for 405 GRDC river basins [hoekstra2011]_.

Processing steps (``workflow/scripts/process_blue_water_availability.py``):

1. **Load basin shapefile** with monthly availability (Mm³/month)
2. **Aggregate by basin and month** to get monthly water budgets

.. figure:: https://github.com/Sustainable-Solutions-Lab/food-opt/releases/download/doc-figures/water_basin_availability.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Basin water availability map

   Annual blue water availability by GRDC river basin (mm/year). The map shows area-normalized yearly water availability across 405 major river basins globally. Higher availability is shown in darker blue, allowing direct comparison between basins of different sizes. While we normalize by area for better visualisation here, food-opt tracks total water amount availability internally.

Regional Water Assignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Blue water availability is allocated to optimization regions based on spatial overlap with basins (``workflow/scripts/build_region_water_availability.py``):

1. **Spatial join**: Intersect region polygons with basin polygons
2. **Area weighting**: Allocate basin water proportional to overlap area
3. **Growing season matching**: Assign water to regions based on when crops are growing

   * Uses growing season start/length from GAEZ
   * Sums monthly availability over the growing period
   * For now, this is done on average over all crops that can grow in the region

4. **Output**: CSV files:

   * ``processing/{name}/water/monthly_region_water.csv``: Monthly water by region
   * ``processing/{name}/water/region_growing_season_water.csv``: Growing season totals

.. figure:: https://github.com/Sustainable-Solutions-Lab/food-opt/releases/download/doc-figures/water_region_availability.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Regional water availability map

   Growing season water availability by optimization region (mm). The map shows area-normalized water available during the average growing season for each region, computed by summing monthly basin availability over the typical crop growing period. This represents the blue water constraint for irrigated crop production in the optimization model.

Irrigated Land Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only a fraction of agricultural land is equipped with irrigation infrastructure. The model uses GAEZ v5's "land equipped for irrigation" dataset (LR-IRR) to determine which land can support irrigated crops.

**Key features:**

* **Spatial variation**: Irrigated land fraction varies by location based on infrastructure, water access, and historical development
* **Land competition**: Rainfed and irrigated production compete for the same physical land
* **Water coupling**: Irrigated land must have both irrigation infrastructure *and* sufficient blue water availability

The following figure shows the global distribution of land equipped for irrigation:

.. figure:: https://github.com/Sustainable-Solutions-Lab/food-opt/releases/download/doc-figures/irrigated_land_fraction.png
   :width: 100%
   :alt: Irrigated land fraction map

   Fraction of land equipped for irrigation from GAEZ v5. Higher values (darker colors) indicate areas with more extensive irrigation infrastructure. Many agricultural regions show low irrigation fractions, limiting irrigated crop production even when water is available.

**Interaction with rainfed cropland:**

Within each optimization region and resource class, the model maintains separate variables for rainfed and irrigated land use. However, these share the same physical land base:

* **Rainfed land limit**: Total suitable cropland minus irrigated share
* **Irrigated land limit**: Total suitable cropland times irrigated share
* **Constraint**: Rainfed area + irrigated area ≤ total suitable cropland

This means that in regions with limited irrigation infrastructure, the model may:

* Prioritize irrigated production on the best land (higher resource classes) when water is available
* Fall back to rainfed production when irrigation infrastructure or water is limiting
* Trade off between high-yield irrigated crops (requiring both infrastructure and water) and lower-yield rainfed crops (requiring neither)

The irrigation infrastructure constraint is particularly important in regions where water is abundant but irrigation systems are not widely deployed, preventing the model from unrealistically converting all suitable land to high-yield irrigated production.

Fertilizer
----------

Crop production requires nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) fertilizers. The model includes:

* **Global fertilizer limit**: Total NPK available (``primary.fertilizer.limit`` in config, specified in kg and converted to Mt internally)
* **Crop-specific requirements**: Fertilizer needed per tonne of production (from ``data/crops.csv``)
* **Emissions factors**: N₂O emissions from nitrogen application

The fertilizer constraint is typically set at a realistic global scale (e.g., 200 Mt NPK/year) to prevent unrealistic intensification.

For now, N, P & K are not differentiated, and their GHG emissions are not tracked appropriately; this is work in development.

Growing Seasons
---------------

Temporal overlap of growing seasons within a region affects:

* **Water availability**: Multiple crops may compete for water during the same months
* **Land use**: Double-cropping potential if growing seasons don't overlap

Currently, the model uses annual time resolution, so it implicitly assumes:

* Each land parcel produces one crop per year
* Water constraints apply to the full growing season

Multiple Cropping
-----------------

Many production systems plant two or more sequential crops on the same parcel. The
model supports this via named combinations declared in ``config/*.yaml`` under
``multiple_cropping``. Each entry specifies a ``crops`` list (duplicates allowed for
double rice) and a ``water_supplies`` array that chooses whether the sequence is rainfed
(``r``) or irrigated (``i``). The preprocessing rule ``build_multi_cropping`` reads the
relevant GAEZ rasters for every crop in each (combination, water supply) pair and:

* filters pixels where any crop lacks suitability or yield data,
* shifts later crops forward by whole-year increments until all growing seasons are
  non-overlapping within a 365-day window, and
* computes the minimum suitable area fraction across the sequence.

Eligible hectares are aggregated to ``processing/{name}/multi_cropping/eligible_area.csv``
alongside the summed irrigated water requirement (``water_requirement_m3_per_ha``); the
column is zero for rainfed variants. Per-cycle yields (tonnes/ha for each step) are written to
``processing/{name}/multi_cropping/cycle_yields.csv`` so downstream steps can preserve
product-specific productivity.

The RES01 classes report the agro-climatic zone the pixel belongs to. We interpret the
numeric codes as:

* 0 – masked (ocean/undefined)
* 1 – no cropping (too cold/dry)
* 2 – single cropping
* 3 – limited double cropping (GAEZ permits relay; we conservatively treat it as sequential
  double cropping with at most one wetland rice cycle)
* 4 – double cropping (no wetland rice sequentially)
* 5 – double cropping with up to one wetland rice crop
* 6 – double rice cropping (limited triple in the documentation is ignored here)
* 7 – triple cropping (≤2 wetland rice crops)
* 8 – triple rice cropping (up to three wetland rice crops)

Relay cropping opportunities mentioned for the C/F zones are intentionally ignored for now; we
only construct sequential crop chains. This assumption is called out in the configuration and
model framework documentation so users know the limitation.

During ``build_model`` each (combination, region, resource class) creates a single
rained or irrigated multi-output link that:

* draws from the matching land bus (``_r`` or ``_i``) used by individual crops,
* emits one crop bus per cycle with efficiencies equal to the aggregated yield,
* charges marginal cost using the sum of crop prices across cycles, and
* deducts the combined fertilizer rate (kg N per ha summed over the crops),
* (irrigated only) withdraws the summed water requirement on the region water bus.

If any required raster is missing the rule fails early to avoid silently enabling
unsupported sequences.

   Rain-fed perspective: top panel shows RES01-MCR classes from GAEZ v5. Bottom panel
   reports the share of each optimisation region where the climate supports sequential
   multi-cropping (zones C–H). Zones suitable only for relay systems are counted as
   sequential double cropping, consistent with the current model assumptions.

   Irrigated perspective: top panel shows RES01-MCI classes. Bottom panel reports the
   share of each optimisation region where irrigated climate conditions allow sequential
   multi-cropping. Relay-only zones are again interpreted as sequential crop chains.

Crop-Specific Data Files
-------------------------

**data/crops.csv**
  Long-form crop parameter table (mock starter data). Each row represents a ``(crop, param)`` pair:

  * ``crop``: Crop identifier matching entries used in configs and raster filenames
  * ``param``: Parameter key (currently ``fertilizer``, ``co2``, or ``ch4``)
  * ``unit``: Unit string for ``value`` (e.g., ``kg/t``)
  * ``value``: Numeric parameter value interpreted according to ``param``
  * ``description``: Free-text explanation of the assumption

  Add new parameters by appending rows; comment lines starting with ``#`` are ignored by loaders.

**data/gaez_crop_code_mapping.csv**
  Lookup table aligning food-opt crop identifiers with GAEZ resource codes. Columns: ``crop_name``, ``description``, and the RES02/RES05/RES06 codes used to locate raster layers.

**data/yield_unit_conversions.csv**
  Optional per-crop overrides for converting raw GAEZ yields to tonnes of dry matter per hectare. Columns: ``code`` (crop identifier), ``factor_to_t_per_ha`` (multiplier applied to raster values), and ``note`` for context. Only sugar crops and oil-palm currently require overrides; all other crops use the default ``0.001`` factor (kg → tonne).

**data/crop_moisture_content.csv**
  Moisture fractions (0-1) for each modelled crop, primarily sourced from the GAEZ v5 Module VII documentation with explicit notes where assumptions were required. Combined with edible portion coefficients to convert dry matter yields into fresh edible mass.

Workflow Rules
--------------

Crop yield processing is handled by the ``build_crop_yields`` rule:

* **Input**: Resource classes, GAEZ rasters (yield, suitability, water, growing season), regions, unit conversions
* **Wildcards**: ``{crop}`` (crop name), ``{water_supply}`` ("r" or "i")
* **Output**: ``processing/{name}/crop_yields/{crop}_{water_supply}.csv``
* **Script**: ``workflow/scripts/build_crop_yields.py``

Run for a specific crop with::

    tools/smk -j1 processing/{name}/crop_yields/wheat_r.csv

Or for all crops automatically via dependencies of the ``build_model`` rule.

.. TODO: update this with reference to yield plotting rule, etc.
