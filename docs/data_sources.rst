**Workflow retrieval**: Automatic via Snakemake rules in ``workflow/rules/retrieve.smk``

USDA Cost and Returns Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA ERS)

**Description**: Detailed production cost estimates (USD/acre) for major field crops in the United States, including operating costs and allocated overhead.

**Temporal coverage**: 1996-2024 (varies by crop)

**Access**: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/commodity-costs-and-returns/

**License**: Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)

**Retrieval**: Direct CSV download via ``workflow/scripts/retrieve_usda_costs.py``. The script implements robust retries (5 attempts with backoff) to handle server instability.

  * **Manual Fallback**: If automated retrieval fails, download the CSVs from the URLs listed in ``data/usda_cost_sources.csv``.

**Coverage**: 9 major crops (corn/maize, wheat, rice, barley, oats, sorghum, soybeans, groundnut/peanuts, cotton)

**Usage**: Bottom-up mechanistic estimates of crop production costs per hectare. Costs are split into:

* **Per-year costs** (annual fixed): Machinery depreciation, farm overhead, taxes/insurance
* **Per-planting costs** (variable): Seed, chemicals, labor, fuel, repairs, custom services

Costs explicitly **excluded** (modeled endogenously):

* Fertilizer costs (nitrogen/phosphorus/potassium modeled separately)
* Land opportunity costs (land allocation is optimized)
* Irrigation water costs (water is a separate constraint)

**Inflation adjustment**: All costs are inflation-adjusted to a configurable base year (default: 2024) using US CPI-U data from BLS. See :ref:`bls-cpi-data` for details.

**Note**: USDA data is merged with EU FADN data (see :ref:`fadn-cost-data`) via the ``merge_crop_costs`` rule to provide comprehensive global coverage. For crops without direct cost data from either source, fallback mappings are applied via ``data/crop_cost_fallbacks.yaml`` (e.g., other cereals use wheat costs, other legumes use soybean costs). When data is available from multiple sources, costs are averaged.

**Usage**: Production cost estimates per unit of output. Costs are converted from per-head-per-year or per-cwt to per-tonne-product for model integration.

Costs explicitly **excluded** (modeled endogenously):

* Feed costs (crops and grassland modeled separately)
* Land costs and grazing rent (land allocation is optimized)

**Included costs**: Labor, veterinary services, energy, housing, equipment depreciation, interest on operating capital

**Inflation adjustment**: Costs are inflation-adjusted to the configurable base year (default: 2024) using US CPI-U data from BLS.

**Note**: USDA animal cost data is merged with EU FADN livestock data via the ``merge_animal_costs`` rule. For products without direct cost data (chicken, eggs), fallback mappings are applied via ``data/animal_cost_fallbacks.yaml`` using pork costs as a proxy. When data is available from multiple sources, costs are averaged.

FADN — Farm Accountancy Data Network (EU)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: European Commission DG Agriculture and Rural Development / LAMASUS project (Zenodo)

**Description**: European Union farm-level accounting database providing economic and structural data for agricultural holdings. This project uses the LAMASUS-processed NUTS-level agricultural dataset, which aggregates FADN farm accounting data (crop outputs, production costs, areas) into standard results by country, year, and farm typology.

**Temporal coverage**: 2004-2020 (this project uses 2015-2020 for consistency with USDA data)

**Geographic coverage**: EU-27 member states

**Access**: https://zenodo.org/records/10939892 (LAMASUS dataset)

**Original FADN**: https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/data-and-analysis/farm-structures-and-economics/fsdn_en

**License**: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) for LAMASUS dataset; original FADN data © European Union, free for non-commercial use with attribution

**Retrieval**: Automatic via ``download_fadn_data`` Snakemake rule (Zenodo direct download)

**Coverage**: 10 crop categories (cereals, protein crops, potatoes, sugar beet, oilseeds, vegetables & flowers, fruit trees, citrus, wine & grapes, olives)

**Cost variables**:

* **Crop-specific costs** (per-planting): Seeds and plants (SE285), crop protection (SE300), other crop-specific costs (SE305)
* **Farm overhead costs** (per-year): Machinery & building costs (SE340), energy (SE345), contract work (SE350), depreciation (SE360), wages paid (SE370), interest paid (SE380)
* **Explicitly EXCLUDED**: Fertilizer costs (SE295 - modeled endogenously), rent paid (SE375 - land opportunity cost modeled endogenously)

**Cost allocation methodology**:

1. **Allocation by Value**: Costs are first allocated to crop categories proportionally by output value share (e.g., if cereals represent 30% of total farm output value, they receive 30% of total costs).
2. **Normalization by Specific Area**: To correctly reflect production intensity, the allocated costs are normalized using **crop-specific area variables** (e.g., SE035 for Cereals, SE046 for Vegetables, SE050 for Vineyards) rather than total farm area. This ensures that intensive crops like vegetables receive a higher cost-per-hectare than extensive crops like cereals, even within the same aggregated farm data.
3. **Group Aggregation**: Crops without specific area variables (e.g., potatoes, sugar beet, oilseeds) are grouped into the "Other Field Crops" category (SE041 area) to calculate a representative group-average cost per hectare.

**Currency and inflation adjustment**:

1. EUR costs are inflation-adjusted to base year (default: 2024) using EU HICP (Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices)
2. Converted to USD using average EUR/USD exchange rate (1.10 for 2015-2024 period)
3. USD values are further adjusted for US inflation using CPI-U to ensure consistency with USDA cost data

**Usage**: Provides production cost estimates for EU agriculture, complementing USDA data with broader crop coverage (vegetables, fruits, etc.). Costs are merged with USDA data via ``merge_crop_costs`` rule; when both sources have data for a crop, values are averaged.

**Workflow integration**: Processed via ``retrieve_fadn_costs`` script → ``processing/{name}/fadn_costs.csv`` → merged with USDA costs → ``processing/{name}/crop_costs.csv`` (final output used by ``build_model``).

**Citation**: Wögerer, M. (2024). LAMASUS NUTS-level agricultural data derived from public FADN 1989-2009 (SGM) & 2004-2020 (SO) (0.1) [Data set]. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10939892

FADN Livestock Costs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The same FADN dataset provides livestock production cost data for animal products:

**Coverage**: 4 livestock categories (dairy cattle, beef cattle, pigs, poultry)

**Cost variables**: Same farm overhead costs as crops (SE340-SE380), plus livestock-specific costs (SE320 - veterinary, breeding, etc.)

**Explicitly EXCLUDED**: Purchased feed costs (SE310 - modeled endogenously), rent paid (SE375)

**Methodology**: A yield-based "bottom-up" approach is used to calculate costs per tonne:

1.  **Allocation**: Farm costs are allocated to livestock categories proportionally by output value, normalized by Total Farm Output (SE131) to properly account for mixed farming systems.
2.  **Unit Cost**: Costs are normalized to **Cost per Head** using Eurostat livestock unit (LU) coefficients (e.g., 1 Dairy Cow = 1 LU, 1 Pig = 0.3 LU).
3.  **Yield Conversion**: Cost per Head is converted to **Cost per Tonne** using country-specific physical yields derived from FAOSTAT (Production / Stocks). This ensures consistent physical metrics across all products and countries, correcting for internal data gaps in FADN reporting.

**Currency adjustment**: Same as crops (EUR → USD using PPP, inflation-adjusted to base year)

**Usage**: Provides EU livestock production cost estimates, complementing USDA data. Costs are merged with USDA animal cost data via ``merge_animal_costs`` rule; when both sources have data for a product, values are averaged.

**Workflow integration**: Processed via ``retrieve_fadn_animal_costs`` script → ``processing/{name}/fadn_animal_costs.csv`` → merged with USDA animal costs → ``processing/{name}/animal_costs.csv`` (final output used by ``build_model``).

**Usage**: Constraining irrigated crop production by basin-level water availability

Huang et al. — Gridded Irrigation Water Withdrawals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: Huang et al. (2018), HESS

**Description**: Monthly gridded irrigation water withdrawals (0.5 degree resolution) for 1971-2010. Used to represent current agricultural water use in validation scenarios.

**Format**: NetCDF (7z bundle)

**Access**: https://zenodo.org/records/1209296

**License**: Open access; citation requested (see below)

**Citation**: Huang, Z., Hejazi, M., Li, X., Tang, Q., Vernon, C., Leng, G., Liu, Y., Doll, P., Eisner, S., Gerten, D., Hanasaki, N., and Wada, Y. (2018).

**Usage**: Aggregated to regions by ``workflow/scripts/process_huang_irrigation_water.py`` when ``config.water.supply_scenario`` is ``current_use``.

Food Processing Data
--------------------

data/foods.csv — Crop-to-Food Processing Pathways
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Type**: Hand-written configuration file (maintained in repository)

**Description**: Defines processing pathways that convert raw crops into food products. Each pathway can produce multiple co-products (e.g., wheat → white flour + bran + germ), with conversion factors maintaining mass balance constraints.

**Format**: CSV with pathway-based structure

**Columns**:
  * ``pathway``: Unique identifier for the processing pathway
  * ``crop``: Input crop name (must match config crops list)
  * ``food``: Output food product name
  * ``factor``: Conversion factor (mass of food per unit mass of crop input)
  * ``description``: Source reference and explanation

**Key features**:
  * **Multi-output pathways**: Multiple rows with the same pathway ID represent co-products from a single processing operation
  * **Alternative pathways**: Different pathways for the same crop (e.g., white flour vs. wholemeal flour) let the model choose optimal processing routes
  * **Mass balance**: Sum of conversion factors per pathway must be ≤ 1.0, with remainder representing unavoidable losses
  * **Validation**: Model validates mass balance constraints when building the network

**Primary source**: FAO Nutrient Conversion Table for Supply Utilization Accounts (2024), sheet 03. Additional factors from literature for specific crops.

**License**: Data in this file is derived from FAO SUA 2024 (© FAO 2024, non-commercial use with attribution) and other cited sources. The pathway structure and organization is original to this project.

**Usage**: ``workflow/scripts/build_model.py`` reads this file and creates multi-output PyPSA Links for each pathway, with efficiencies adjusted for country-specific food loss and waste factors.

**Maintenance**: This is a hand-written configuration file that users should review and potentially customize for their analysis. When adding new crops or food products, corresponding pathways must be added to this file with appropriate conversion factors and source citations.

Nutritional Data
----------------

USDA FoodData Central
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service

**Description**: Comprehensive food composition database providing nutritional data for foods. This project uses the SR Legacy (Standard Reference) database, which contains laboratory-analyzed nutrient data for over 7,000 foods.

**Access**: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/ (web interface) or via REST API

**API Documentation**: https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html

**License**: Public domain under CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0). No permission needed for use, but USDA requests attribution.

**Citation**: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service. FoodData Central. fdc.nal.usda.gov.

**Usage**: Nutritional composition of model foods (protein, carbohydrates, fat, energy)

**Workflow retrieval**: Optional via ``retrieve_usda_nutrition`` rule (using the API with included API key)

**Configuration**: Set ``data.usda.retrieve_nutrition: true`` in config to fetch fresh data. By default, the repository includes pre-fetched data in ``data/nutrition.csv``.

**API Key**: The repository includes a shared API key for convenience. Users can optionally obtain their own API key (free, instant signup) at https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-key-signup and update the ``data.usda.api_key`` value in the config.

The mapping from model foods to USDA FoodData Central IDs is maintained in ``data/usda_food_mapping.csv``. This file maps internal food names (e.g., "flour-white", "rice-white", "meat-chicken") to specific FDC IDs from the SR Legacy database (e.g., wheat flour white all-purpose enriched, white rice cooked, chicken breast raw).

FAO Nutrient Conversion Table for SUA (2024)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provider**: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)

**Description**: Official nutrient conversion factors that align FAO Supply Utilization Account (SUA) quantities with macro- and micronutrient totals for hundreds of food items.

**Access**: https://www.fao.org/3/CC9678EN/Nutrient_conversion_table_for_SUA_2024.xlsx

**License**: © FAO 2024. Reuse for private study, research, teaching, or other non-commercial purposes is allowed with acknowledgement of FAO; translation, adaptation, resale, and commercial uses require prior permission via copyright@fao.org.

**Workflow retrieval**: Automatically downloaded to ``data/downloads/fao_nutrient_conversion_table_for_sua_2024.xlsx`` by the ``download_fao_nutrient_conversion_table`` rule in ``workflow/rules/retrieve.smk``.

**Usage**: Contains data on edible portion of foods. ``workflow/scripts/prepare_fao_edible_portion.py`` reads sheet ``03`` to export edible portion coefficients for configured crops into ``processing/{name}/fao_edible_portion.csv``. Moisture fractions required for fresh-mass scaling live in ``data/crop_moisture_content.csv`` (derived primarily from the GAEZ v5 Module VII documentation with a few documented assumptions) and are joined inside ``workflow/scripts/build_model.py``. Note that for certain crops (grains: rice, barley, oat, buckwheat; sugar crops: sugarcane, sugarbeet; oil crops: oil-palm), the script overrides FAO's coefficients to 1.0 so that downstream processing pathways manage the losses explicitly.
