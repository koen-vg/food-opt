Health Impacts
==============

Overview
--------

The health module converts dietary choices in the optimisation into monetised
health impacts. It combines epidemiological evidence on diet–disease links with
country-level baseline mortality and demographic data, and then represents that
relationship inside the linear programme through carefully constructed
piecewise-linear (SOS2) approximations. The objective therefore weighs
production, environmental and health costs in a consistent monetary unit.

Key ideas:

- Dietary risk factors from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study underpin
  the exposure–response curves.
- Countries are grouped into health clusters to keep the optimisation tractable
  while preserving heterogeneity in baseline burden and valuation.
- Relative risks multiply across risk factors, so we work in log space to turn
  the problem into additions that can be linearised.

Data Inputs
-----------

``workflow/scripts/prepare_health_costs.py`` assembles the following datasets:

- **Baseline diet** (``data/health/processed/diet_intake.csv``): average daily
  intake by country and food item.
- **Relative risks** (``data/health/processed/relative_risks.csv``): dose–response
  pairs for each (risk factor, disease cause) combination.
- **Mortality rates** (``data/health/processed/mortality.csv``): cause-specific
  death rates by age, country and year.
- **Population and life tables** (``processing/{name}/population_age.csv`` and
  ``processing/{name}/life_table.csv``): age-structured population counts and
  remaining life expectancy schedules.

Dietary Risk Factors
--------------------

The model incorporates dietary risk factors as defined by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021 [Brauer2024]_. These risk factors link dietary intake patterns to specific disease outcomes through dose-response relationships.

GBD Risk Factor Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table reproduces the GBD 2021 dietary risk factor definitions from Brauer et al. (2024, Supplementary Appendix 1, p. 171). All intake quantities are expressed in terms of **fresh (as consumed) weight** unless otherwise specified. The optimal intake levels represent the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) used in GBD burden calculations:

**Notes:**

* All intake quantities are in **fresh (as consumed) weight**, matching the GDD dietary intake data convention (see :doc:`current_diets`)
* **GBD risk factors are evaluated for adult populations (≥25 years)** - the implementation weights dietary intake over ages ≥ ``health.intake_age_min`` (25 by default) using age-specific populations
* The model currently implements a subset of these risk factors based on data availability and model scope
* SSB risk-factor exposures are converted to refined sugar equivalents using :code:`health.ssb_sugar_g_per_100g`; added-sugar intake from GDD (variable ``v35``) is aggregated into the same refined-sugar risk factor.
* All risk factors use a generous flat tail at :code:`health.intake_cap_g_per_day` (1 000 g/person/day by default) so equality constraints can exceed observed data without driving the SOS2 outside its domain.
* Risk factor definitions specify both the intake measure (e.g., grams per day) and the threshold or optimal range
* "Diet low in" risk factors specify minimum recommended intakes; "diet high in" risk factors treat any intake as risk-increasing
* Milk/dairy measurements use milk equivalents, where cheese and yogurt are converted to their milk equivalent weight
* See :doc:`current_diets` for detailed mapping between GDD dietary intake data and these risk factors

Preparation Workflow
--------------------

The preprocessing script performs these steps:

1. **Health clustering** – groups countries into ``health.region_clusters``
   clusters using a multi-objective approach that balances three criteria:

   - **Geographic proximity**: countries close together tend to cluster together
     (weight: ``health.clustering.weights.geography``)
   - **GDP per capita similarity**: countries with similar economic development
     levels cluster together (weight: ``health.clustering.weights.gdp``)
   - **Population balance**: clusters are refined to have roughly equal total
     populations (weight: ``health.clustering.weights.population``)

   The algorithm projects country geometries to an equal-area CRS, computes
   centroids, and runs weighted K-means on a feature matrix combining geography
   and log-transformed GDP per capita. An iterative refinement step then
   reassigns boundary countries from over-populated to under-populated clusters
   until the population coefficient of variation reaches an acceptable level.
   The cluster map is saved as ``processing/{name}/health/country_clusters.csv``.
2. **Baseline burden** – combines mortality, population and life expectancy to
   compute years of life lost (YLL) per country and aggregates them to the
   health clusters. For each cause, it also computes a **diet-attributable YLL**
   using the population-attributable fraction :math:`\\text{PAF} = 1 - 1/\\mathrm{RR}`
   derived from baseline intakes and the RR curves. The results go into
   ``processing/{name}/health/cluster_cause_baseline.csv`` and
   ``processing/{name}/health/cluster_summary.csv``.
3. **Record cluster totals** – store each cluster’s population for scaling; the
   solver multiplies baseline YLLs by the configured ``health.value_per_yll``
   constant (no external valuation dataset required).
4. **Risk-factor breakpoints** – builds grids of intake values by taking
   evenly spaced knots (``health.intake_grid_points``) over the empirical RR
   data range, then adding observed exposures, TMREL, baseline intakes, and
   the generous cap ``health.intake_cap_g_per_day``. It evaluates
   :math:`\log(RR)` for every (risk, cause) pair. These tables are written to
   ``processing/{name}/health/risk_breakpoints.csv``.
5. **Cause-level breakpoints** – as the optimisation needs to recover
   :math:`RR = \exp(\sum_r \log RR_{r})`, the script also constructs breakpoints
   for the aggregated log-relative-risk and its exponential. Stored as
   ``processing/{name}/health/cause_log_breakpoints.csv``.

The generated tables drive the linearisation in
``workflow/scripts/solve_model.py``.

From Diet to Risk Exposure
--------------------------

Per-capita intake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During optimisation, consumption flows are tracked on links named
``consume_<food>_<ISO3>``. For each health cluster :math:`c` and risk factor
:math:`r`, the solver forms a per-capita intake by combining these flows with
shares from ``workflow/scripts/health_food_mapping.py``:

.. math::

   I_{c,r} = \frac{10^{6}}{365\,P_c} \sum_{f \in \mathcal{F}_r} \alpha_{f,r} \; q_{c,f}

where

- :math:`q_{c,f}` is the aggregated flow in million tonnes per year for food
  :math:`f` consumed by cluster :math:`c`;
- :math:`\alpha_{f,r}` is the share of food :math:`f` attributed to risk factor
  :math:`r` (currently 1.0 or 0.0);
- :math:`P_c` is the population represented by the cluster (baseline or updated
  planning population);
- the constant rescales from Mt/year to g/day.

Linearised relative risk curves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each risk factor :math:`r` affects a subset of causes :math:`g`. The data from
``risk_breakpoints.csv`` provides intake breakpoints
:math:`x_0, \ldots, x_K` and the corresponding
:math:`\log RR_{r,g}(x_k)` values. For every (cluster, risk) pair we introduce
SOS2 “lambda” variables :math:`\lambda_k` that satisfy

.. math::
   \sum_k \lambda_k = 1,\qquad I_{c,r} = \sum_k x_k\,\lambda_k,

and approximate the log-relative-risk as

.. math::
   \log RR_{c,r,g} = \sum_k \lambda_k\, \log RR_{r,g}(x_k).

SOS2 constraints keep only two adjacent :math:`\lambda_k` active, yielding a
piecewise-linear interpolation without binary decision variables when the
solver supports SOS2. When HiGHS is used, the implementation falls back to a
compact binary formulation.

Aggregating across risk factors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Epidemiological evidence models the combined effect of multiple risk factors on
one cause as multiplicative:

.. math::
   RR_{c,g} = \prod_{r \in \mathcal{R}_g} RR_{c,r,g}.

Taking logarithms converts this to a sum that remains compatible with linear
programming:

.. math::
   \log RR_{c,g} = \sum_{r \in \mathcal{R}_g} \log RR_{c,r,g}.

The solver accumulates the contributions from each risk factor into
``log_rr_totals`` for every cluster–cause pair.

Recovering total relative risk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The optimisation needs :math:`RR_{c,g}` again to price health damages. The
preprocessed ``cause_log_breakpoints.csv`` supplies points
:math:`(z_m, \exp(z_m))` that cover the feasible range of
:math:`z = \log RR_{c,g}`. A second SOS2 interpolation enforces

.. math::
   z = \sum_m z_m \theta_m,\qquad RR_{c,g} = \sum_m e^{z_m} \theta_m,

with :math:`\sum_m \theta_m = 1`. This gives a consistent linearised mapping
from the aggregated log-relative-risk back to the multiplicative relative risk.

Monetising years of life lost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each cluster–cause pair the preprocessing step stores
:math:`\mathrm{YLL}^{\mathrm{base}}_{c,g}` (baseline years of life lost). The
solver also records the reference log-relative-risk
:math:`z^{\mathrm{ref}}_{c,g}` (from TMREL intake levels) and its exponential
:math:`RR^{\mathrm{ref}}_{c,g}`. The contribution to the objective is
constructed as

.. math::
   \text{Cost}_{c,g} = V\, \mathrm{YLL}^{\mathrm{base}}_{c,g}
   \left( \frac{RR_{c,g}}{RR^{\mathrm{ref}}_{c,g}} - 1 \right).

where :math:`V` is the value per year of life lost (configured in
``health.value_per_yll`` as USD_2024 per YLL), and
:math:`RR^{\mathrm{ref}}_{c,g}` is the relative risk when all risk
factors are at their TMREL levels. This formulation ensures the health
cost is exactly zero when intake is at TMREL.

Since TMREL represents the theoretical minimum risk level, relative risk curves
reach their minimum at TMREL intake. Therefore :math:`RR_{c,g} \geq RR^{\mathrm{ref}}_{c,g}`
always, and health costs are non-negative. PyPSA store energy levels directly
encode the deviation from optimal:

.. math::
   e_{c,g} = (RR_{c,g} - RR^{\mathrm{ref}}_{c,g})
   \cdot \frac{\mathrm{YLL}^{\mathrm{base}}_{c,g}}{RR^{\mathrm{ref}}_{c,g}}
   \cdot 10^{-6}

measured in million years of life lost relative to TMREL baseline. The
monetary contribution is ``marginal_cost_storage × e``.

Interpreting Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The optimization objective includes health costs measured relative to TMREL:

- **Zero health cost**: All dietary intakes are at TMREL levels (optimal, minimum risk)
- **Positive health cost**: Intake deviates from TMREL, increasing disease burden relative to optimal

Objective Contribution
----------------------

``workflow/scripts/solve_model.py`` adds the summed cost over all clusters and
causes to the PyPSA objective. If the solver exposes SOS2 constraints, the
implementation keeps the formulation linear without integer variables; for
HiGHS a tight binary fallback is activated.

Configuration Highlights
------------------------

.. literalinclude:: ../config/default.yaml
   :language: yaml
   :start-after: # --- section: health ---
   :end-before: # --- section: aggregation ---

Lowering ``region_clusters`` or ``log_rr_points`` eases the optimisation at the
cost of coarser health resolution. ``health.intake_grid_points`` controls the
density of the first-stage interpolation grid; smaller values give smoother
curves but produce larger tables.

Outputs
-------

The preprocessing rule saves all intermediate products under
``processing/{name}/health/``. Downstream plotting rules also create quick-look
maps (``results/{name}/plots/health_*.pdf``) and CSV summaries to compare
baseline versus optimised health outcomes.
