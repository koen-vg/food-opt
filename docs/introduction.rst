Introduction
============

Overview
--------

**food-opt** is a global food systems optimization model that is designed to study the trade-offs between optimizing for both positive health outcomes as well as desirable environmental outcomes. The model uses a resource flow-based structure implemented with PyPSA/linopy to jointly optimize food production, processing, trade and consumption patterns.

Key Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The model balances multiple objectives:

* **Environmental sustainability**: Minimize greenhouse gas emissions (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O), land use change, nitrogen pollution, and water use
* **Health outcomes**: Minimize disease burden from dietary risk factors

These objectives are co-optimized for while operating within biophysical limits on crop yields, land availability, and irrigation capacity as well as satisfying constraints on nutritional adequacy in terms of macronutrients.

Key Features
------------

Food System Coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Crop production**: more than 60 different crops with spatially-explicit yield potentials
* **Livestock systems**: Multiple production systems (grazing vs. feed-based) for meat and dairy
* **Food processing and trade**: Accounting for waste losses, trading frictions and more
* **Nutritional assessment**: Mapping to food group-based dietary risk factors and health outcomes

Environmental Impact Assessment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Greenhouse gas emissions from production, land use change, and nitrogen fertilization
* Land use change impacts with spatially-explicit carbon storage estimates
* Water use constraints based on irrigation infrastructure and basin-level availability
* Nitrogen pollution from fertilizer application

Health and Nutrition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Macronutrient constraints to ensure basic nutritional adequacy
* Integration with Global Burden of Disease dietary risk factors
* Population-level health impact assessment in terms of years of life lost
* Health valuation via a configurable value-per-YLL constant

Global Extent & Flexible Spatial Resolution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Geophysical input data at high-resolution gridcell level (0.05° × 0.05°)
* Optimization at configurable sub-national regional scale
* Global coverage with detailed country and regional analysis

   Global model coverage showing optimization regions. The model divides the world into sub-national regions (here 250 regions) that balance spatial detail with computational tractability. Each colored polygon represents an optimization region created by clustering administrative units.

Getting Started
---------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Python >= 3.12
* `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ for dependency management
* `Snakemake <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/>`_ workflow management system
* Linear programming solver (open source HiGHS solver included, proprietary Gurobi optional)

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Clone the repository::

    git clone <repository-url>
    cd food-opt

2. Install dependencies::

    uv sync

3. Retrieve Global Dietary Database and Global Burden of Disease datasets manually (see ``data/manually_downloaded/README.md`` and the :ref:`manual-download-checklist`)

4. The workflow will automatically download required datasets when first run.

Quick Start
-----------

Running Your First Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The quickest path to a runnable scenario is:

1. Copy the defaults::

       cp config/default.yaml config/my_scenario.yaml

2. Edit ``config/my_scenario.yaml`` and add a ``name`` field near the top (for
   example ``name: "my_scenario"``).

3. Run the workflow with your scenario file::

       tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/my_scenario.yaml all

This sequence will:

1. Download required global datasets (GAEZ, GADM, UN population, etc.)
2. Process and harmonize spatial data for the configured countries
3. Build the linear programming model
4. Solve the optimization problem
5. Generate summary statistics and visualizations

Results will be saved under ``results/my_scenario/``.

Understanding the Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Snakemake workflow is organized into stages:

* **Data preparation**: Population, regions, resource classes, crop yields
* **Model building**: Assemble PyPSA network with all constraints
* **Solving**: Run the linear program with configured solver
* **Visualization**: Generate maps, plots, and CSV exports

You can target individual stages by specifying the output file. For example, to only build the model without solving::

    tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/my_scenario.yaml results/my_scenario/build/model.nc

Or to just prepare regional aggregation::

    tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/my_scenario.yaml processing/my_scenario/regions.geojson

See :doc:`workflow` for detailed information on the workflow stages.

Configuring Your First Scenario
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The baseline configuration (``config/default.yaml``) provides a starting point. Key parameters to adjust:

* ``countries``: List of ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes to include
* ``aggregation.regions.target_count``: Number of optimization regions (trade-off between detail and solve time)
* ``crops``: Which crops to include in the model
* ``emissions.ghg_price``: Carbon price in USD/tCO2-eq
* ``macronutrients``: Minimum dietary requirements

After editing the configuration, create a new named scenario by changing the ``name`` field at the top of the file, then run::

    tools/smk -j4 --configfile config/<your-name>.yaml all

Results will be saved under ``results/<your-name>/``.

Project Structure

Important Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The ``results/`` directory contains auto-generated files—never edit these manually
* Several CSV files (``data/feed_conversion.csv``, ``data/feed_to_animal_products.csv``, ``data/food_groups.csv``) contain mock placeholder data
* Always use the ``tools/smk`` wrapper to run Snakemake, as it enforces memory limits to prevent system instability
* The first run will take significant time to download global datasets (~several GB)
