"""Rules for optimal taxes/subsidies workflow.

This workflow:
1. Runs optimization with health/GHG objectives to derive optimal consumption
2. Extracts consumption patterns from the optimized model
3. Fixes consumption to optimal values and solves with production costs only
4. Extracts dual variables as optimal Pigouvian taxes/subsidies
5. Resolves the model with taxes/subsidies applied in the objective
