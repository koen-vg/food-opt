"""Extract optimal taxes from food group equality constraint duals.

Taxes represent the Pigouvian tax (positive) or subsidy (negative) needed
to incentivize the optimal consumption pattern derived in Stage 1.

The dual variable (shadow price) of each consumption constraint indicates
the marginal cost of forcing that consumption level when only production
costs are considered. This is the tax/subsidy that would make the
production-cost-only equilibrium match the health/GHG-optimal outcome.

Interpretation:
- Positive dual: Increasing consumption at this constraint increases production
  cost. The health/GHG-optimal consumption is higher than what pure production
  costs would yield, so a SUBSIDY is needed to encourage more consumption.
- Negative dual: Increasing consumption would decrease production cost (e.g.,
  due to economies of scale or efficient utilization). The optimal consumption
  is lower, so a TAX is needed to discourage consumption.

Therefore: tax = -dual (positive tax discourages, negative tax = subsidy encourages)
